# Contributing to Open Source

This past week I went to my local python user group's (PyMNtos) monthly Meetup. One of the presentations by Donnie Berkholz (@dberkholz), really caught my attention. The topic was contributing to open source software. It was part how-to and part lessons learned. It covered everything from where to find mailing lists, to what tools to use, to what to look for in an open source community. He walked through several popular open source python projects and demonstrated how to start contributing to them.
