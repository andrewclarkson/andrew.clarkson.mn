Thirty Day Blogging Challenge
-----------------------------

I'm undertaking the 30 day blogging challenge. I was inspired by [Matt Cutts](https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/)'s 30 day challenges. His idea isn't new, it's cliche by now, but having read his blog and watched his videos, it seem like an interesting idea. I've referred to his advice many times on technical issues regarding search indexing--yes, I am avoiding using that aweful three letter acronym. If he can take on so many new things with his schedule, so can I.

I hate the term perfectionist because it sounds like the interview equivalent of name dropping. It's a little like announcing your greatest insecurity is being too pretty. It doesn't sound debilitating. It doesn't sound like something that consistently stops you from learning new things. I'd rather say I am scared. I'm scared of fucking up. That's the naked truth.

Being scared of fucking up wouldn't be so bad, if I didn't fuck up. I fuck up a lot. My many mistakes range from missing the bus and procrastinating to hypocrasy and being a jerk. I tell every aspriring programmer that will listen that progress means errors. You will get it wrong, you have to push through it. But it's a lot easier to say that when your mistakes are private. No one need know how many segfaults there are in my personal projects. I'm scared of people knowing I fucked up.

This brings me to the idea of blogging. I'm not a great writer. I think english is a terrible, clumsy language. It is public (however obscure and insignificant). It is solidly outside my comfort zone, especially when I'm talking about feelings. It's going to be bad before it gets better. I'm going to get it wrong, I'm going to have to push through it. Worst case I waste a month toiling in obscurity, right? Right?

Here we go.
