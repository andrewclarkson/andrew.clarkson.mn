Statistical Optimism
====================

Recently long standing tensions between African-Americans and the police seem to have boiled over. In my home, the Twin Cities Filando Castille was shot and killed in a traffic stop. Many of my dear friends are furious one going so far as to say that relations between the black community and police are worse than they were during the civil rights movement of the early 60's. Several of my friends have said violence has been getting worse in recent years painting an almost apocalyptic vision of the future.

Whenever particularly tragic and sensational events (terrorism, plane crashes, police shootings) take place, I try to dig up some data. It's well known that when strong emotions are attached to an event it make humans think that occurance is more prevalent than it actually is. A colloquial example is flying on a plane vs. driving. Driving is in reality much more dangerous, but plane crashes are so spectacular and emotionally charged that most people are left with a distorted perspective. Numbers bring us back to reality. From data we can infer more correct views on how the world really works.

Let's start with shooting deaths for black males. This is about as close as you can get to data on police shootings.
